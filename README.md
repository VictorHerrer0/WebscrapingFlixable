# Webscraping with Beautifulsoup

## Ever wondered which Netflix movies are rated highest?
I have... and apparently there is no such option to sort Movies by rating... I found this a bit disppointing and decided to find the ultimate solution.

## What is webscraping?
Webscraping is a process in which an individual writes code to interact with websites. It can be used to automate processes, extract information and basically do all sorts of "human interactions" with websites.
In this case I used Beautifulsoup, a library built for webscraping, to extract data from a website called "Flixable".

## Workflow
I wanted to extract a dataset containing the best rated Netflix-movies on Flixable. The idea is to automate this script so that every month I get a list of the best rated movies from the last two rolling-years. I wanted to automate the script using either task scheduler or the macOS calendar + automator.
The first thing on the list was to extract the data and get comfortable using Beatifulsoup. The data cleaning process was rather simple.
